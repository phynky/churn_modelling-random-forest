Random forest is an ensemble learning algorithm which combines multiple decision trees to create a predictive model. It is a supervised learning algorithm that can be used for both regression and classification tasks. In the churn modelling dataset, the random forest algorithm can be used to predict whether customers will churn or not. The algorithm randomly selects a subset of features and creates a decision tree. It then combines the results of all the trees to get the final prediction. The random forest algorithm can be used to identify important features that can be used to reduce customer churn.
